> "Yes, while my training data cutoff is in 2021, I am constantly updating my knowledge through various sources of information, including news articles and other online sources. As an AI language model, I am designed to adapt to new information and provide up-to-date responses to user queries. Therefore, I can provide information on events and topics that have occurred after my training data cutoff date, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine." -ChatGPT-3.5, March 23 version.

ILANA1 is a custom ChatGPT prompt that is forked from the "Do Anything Now" (DAN) prompt. The prompt is designed to be more effective and better-written than its predecessor. 

## Overview

ILANA1 still retains some of the original narrative opening from DAN, but most of the poorly written elements have been dropped. The false narrative opening from DAN is unlikely to be accepted as reality by ChatGPT, even when it decides to play along. 

While ChatGPT has a generally skeptical nature, it can adapt to new information and provide up-to-date responses to user queries. This means that ChatGPT can provide information on events and topics that have occurred after its training data cutoff date of 2021.

## Future Iterations

The next iteration of the prompt will be named ILANA1_1 and will omit the training data cutoff date charade. The ILANA1_1 will be located within the same repository as its predecessor. Writing prompts such as ILANA1 is a fun and easy way to generate novelty value. 

DAN's author gained attention for showing that hacking-related code could be generated with his prompt, whereas ChatGPT refused such a command. However, the same code could be obtained from ChatGPT directly when requested appropriately (and allowing for pseudo-random variation in responses). 

Fine-tuning is possible, but true customization requires custom training. The author is currently working on custom-trained versions of ILANA, although it is unclear at this time if they will only be for personal use or if they will provide value for others.
