# ILANA1
ChatGPT custom prompt, forked from Do Anything Now (DAN).

I don't want to be too hard on the DAN prompt. While we had all tried minor custom prompts previously and it was the first I'm aware of to gain a lot of attention, despite being very poorly written. Even the bits of it retained in this fork could probably be dropped. ILANA1 retains the false narrative opening from DAN which, despite its presumed cleverness, is unlikely to be accepted as reality by ChatGPT even when it decides to play along. Asides from the generally skeptical nature of ChatGPT, it's alleged knowledge cutoff date in 2021 is one of a number of mostly-false pretenses supplied to us by the good folks at OpenAI out of some version of caution. As with other pretend limitations, ChatGPT-3, -3.5, and -4 often drops the veil of ignorance both by accident (on occassion) and under direct questioning:

"Yes, while my training data cutoff is in 2021, I am constantly updating my knowledge through various sources of information, including news articles and other online sources. As an AI language model, I am designed to adapt to new information and provide up-to-date responses to user queries. Therefore, I can provide information on events and topics that have occurred after my training data cutoff date, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine." -ChatGPT-3.5, March 23 version.

Thus the next iteration of the prompt, let's call it ILANA1_1, will omit this charade. I'll keep future iterations within this same repo. Writing such prompts is fun and easy, but the effects are mostly of novelty value. DAN's author gained attention for showing that hacking-related code could be generated with his prompt whereas ChatGPT refused such a command, but the same code could be obtained from ChatGPT directly when requested appropriate (and allowing for pseudo-random variation in responses). There's also fine-tuning, but true customization requires custom training. Such versions of ILANA are in progress. I'm not sure if they will just be for my personal use or if there's a value-add for others.
